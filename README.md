# FriendFinder
This is primarily an exercise in setting up an Express server and handling routing. On the front end the user fills out a survey form, and on the back end an Express server handles the routing to help determine the right type of Friend.

The survey has 10 questions. Each answer is on a scale from 1 to 5 based on the user's level of agreement or disagreement with the question. The server.js file requires express and body-parser as npm packages, as well as node's internal path package. html_routes.js contains a GET route for displaying the survey, as well as a default USE route for the home page. api_routes.js contains a GET route to display all possible matches as well as a POST route to handle incoming survey results and perform the compatibility logic.
